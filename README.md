# My Workspace

## About
This is a general purpose workspace for development in Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms and Signal Processing.

The work in this repository is intended to explore core concepts and provide working examples to reinforce the learning of the subject matter.  All work is developed in Python.

## Signal Processing
This is a general purpose workspace to review Signal Processing concepts/techniques.
Any error in the Python code should be attribued to me.

The work in this repository is intended to explore core concepts and provide working examples to reinforce the learning of the subject matter.  All work is developed in Python.

## Machine Learning
This is a general purpose workspace to review Machine Learning algorithms.

In general, this work is inspired by the material covered by Professor Matt Gormley course at Carnegie Mellon (here [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601-s17/index.html)). Any error in the Python code should be attribued to me and not the aforemention author.
